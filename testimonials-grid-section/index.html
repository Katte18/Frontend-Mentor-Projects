          <p class="testimonial-heading">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>

        <div>
          <p><q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</q></p>

    <p class="testimonial-heading fifth">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="testimonial-comment"><q>Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
    me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
    things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
    wait long for assistance. The agile team
    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
    have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
    helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
    100% recommend!</q></p>
